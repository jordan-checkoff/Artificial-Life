# Artificial-Life

My goal was to get my creature to jump. Specifically, I wanted to maximize the time that my creature was off the ground. To calculate fitness, I counted the number of timesteps for which my creature was not touching the ground. To compare parent to child, I measured which had a greater fitness value.
