# Artificial-Life

To make my random snakes, I first calculated a random number of links between 2 and 10. Each link had a random length between 0 to 2, random width between 0.5 to 1, and random height between 0.5 to 1. Each link was randomly assigned a 0 or 1, with a 1 corresponding to a sensor neuron. A sensor neuron was generated for each link with a 1, and every link was assigned a motor neuron. A synapse was created between each sensor neuron and each motor neuron.
